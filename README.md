# exokin

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Maintenant, vous pouvez lancer le backend dans un terminal avec npm start dans le dossier backend,
  et lancer l'application Flutter avec flutter run. L'application devrait afficher "Backend status:
  ok".
